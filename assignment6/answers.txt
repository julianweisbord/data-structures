1) tim and mit will return the same hashing value because they have the same letters.
This will not be the same using stringHash2 because it is multiplying the location in the string array by its index plus 1.
This will cause each letter to have a different value depending on its location but in stringhash1 it is independent of its location.
2) Stringhash2 is better because you won't get the same has index for two different words.
3) No because each word is a hashLink, even if it is also a bucket.
4) yes, this is the same as answer 1.
5) Yes, different hash functions will organize the keys differently, resulting in possibly more or less empty buckets
6) yes a prime number will run the program more efficiently.(less empty buckets). this is because modular operator will always result in a non zero number when a prime number is used.
7) it appears to be directly linearer seen in the graph

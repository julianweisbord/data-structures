1.
push 8 elements so doubles to 16 add 8 to time
copy 8 elements so add 16 to time
double to 32
copy 16 so add 32 to time
total amount of time is 56 it is O(1+)

2. 16 pushes
add 8 items t=8
copy 8 and add 2 t=10
copy 10 and add 2 t=12
copy 12 and add 2 t=14
copy 14 add 2 t=16
copy 16 and add 2 t=18
copy 18 and add 2 t=20
copy 20 and add 2 t=22
copy 22 and add 2 t=24
copy 24 and add 2 t=26
copy 26 and add 2 t=28
copy 28 and add 2 t=30
copy 30 and add 2 t=32
This appears to be O(n) complexity
total time is 260
3.
This construct would run the most poorly when we are at n/2 and push and then pop.
To avoid this we could shrink the capacity to half when it is n/4 times full or n/8
